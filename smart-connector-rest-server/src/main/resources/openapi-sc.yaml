  title: Knowledge Engine REST Developer API
  
  description:
    This API describes how Smart Connectors are instantiated, Knowledge
    Interactions are (un)registered and data is exchanged. Each Smart Connector
    is coupled with a Knowledge Base Id, so every rest call uses this Knowledge
    Base Id to identify yourself.

            examples:
              without lease:
                value:
                  knowledgeBaseId: http://example.org/a-knowledge-base-id

                  knowledgeBaseName: Example Knowledge Base
                  knowledgeBaseDescription: This is a detailed description
                  leaseRenewalTime: 60
                description:
                  The created smart connector will be cleaned up automatically
                  after about 60 seconds. To postpone the cleanup, your
                  knowledge base has to call /sc/lease/renew to extend the lease
                  by 60 seconds.
              with reasoner enabled:
                value:
                  knowledgeBaseId: http://example.org/a-knowledge-base-id
                  knowledgeBaseName: Example Knowledge Base
                  knowledgeBaseDescription: This is a detailed description
                  reasonerEnabled: true
                description:
                  The reasoner is disabled by default. If enabled, the created smart 
                  connector will use a reasoner to orchestrate the data exchange. 
                  This increases the flexibility, but can decrease the performance 
                  and cause unexpected behaviour, for now. This flexibility means the 
                  smart connector will automatically try to combine data coming 
                  from different knowledge bases or try to convert units of measures. 
                  If the reasoner is disabled, the smart connector will only exchange 
                  data with other smart connectors if their graph patterns match 
                  entirely (apart from ordering and variable names).

        It will block until the client is expected to handle something in which
        case it returns. When it returns, a new request to this same endpoint
        should be made to receive further handle requests. Any missed handle requests 
        are queued at the server-side and returned one at a time. All handle
        requests (both for Answer and React Knowledge Interactions) for the
        given Knowledge-Base-Id will be received via a single long polling http
        connection. The Knowledge Interaction Id can be used to distinguish
        between different Knowledge Interactions. The *handle request id*
        (which is unique per Knowledge Base Id) should be used when sending the
        result back to the server. It allows the server to know which handle
        request you are reacting to in the *post* method of this path.
